For our transformation process, we take 10 seconds worth of
accelerometer samples (200 records/lines in the raw file) 
and transform them into a single example/tuple of 46 values.
Most of the features we generate are simple statistical 
measures.

UNIQUE_ID is just that, a unique identifier for each tuple.
	We exclude this field when making predictions

user is the id number of the userthat the data is from. 

X0..x9, Y0..Y9, Z0..Z9 are bins, their values are the fraction
	of accelerometer samples that fell within that bin

XAVG, YAVG, ZAVG are the average x, y, and z values over the
	200 records in the example.

XPEAK, YPEAK, ZPEAK are approximations of the dominant 
	frequency. First, the greatest value in the series is 
	identified, then all local peak values within 10% of
	its amplitude are identified. If the number of peaks 
	is less than 3, then the threshhold is lowered until 
	at least 3 peaks can be found. The times between 
	consecutive peaks are summed and divided by the number
	of peaks.
	
XABSOLDEV, YABSOLDEV, ZABSOLDEV are the average absolute 
	deviations from the mean value for each axis.

XSTANDDEV, YSTANDDEV, ZSTANDDEV are the standard deviations
	for each axis.

RESULTANT is the average of the square roots of the sum of the values 
	of each axis squared âˆš(xi^2 + yi^2 + zi^2).

class is the activity that the user was performing during this example.
